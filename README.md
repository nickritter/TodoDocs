# TODO From Doc
## Goal
App scans a document to certain keyword or markup and populates a to-do list. Complete with alerts.

Could be useful for writers or coders where you want to get back to something, but have a hard time remembering all those unfinished ideas. Sure you could use the find feature, but this lets you see everything all in one place.

## Features
- [ ] Live doc link can update your to-do list on the fly as you write.
- [ ] Maybe app opens when you open the doc?? No idea how to do this.
- [ ] You don't upload a file, the app connects to it with a file path.
    - [ ] How to do this securely?
    - [ ] Only loads todo items.
- [ ] No login. Do some sort of hash? How does Trezor do it? 
    - [ ] Somehow the data exists online saved to a hash rather than a full "account" and all you need is the hash key to unlock that account rather than a password.
    - [ ] Or for the time being, it's all localized.
- [ ] Make changes to the notes in the app and they update in your doc.
